# Spotify User History

Learning project for integrating an API, error handling, logging and saving data to MongoDB.

Due to these learning goals, this project does not use [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/) or [Tekore](https://tekore.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).
If you want to write a similar script, using either of these Spotify API wrappers will likely result in a more robust solution, as they are actively maintained and provide a lot more features.
